                PSD2, the Payment Services Directive, is a mandate of the European Union (EU) that enables business and consumer banking customers to use third-party providers to manage financial transactions. The regulation requires banks to provide these third-parties, including PISPs (Payment Initiation Service Providers) and AISPs (Account Information Service Providers) access to their customers accounts through open APIs.

                   PSD2 fundamentally changes the nature of retail banking when any of the participants (bank, customer, merchant, or third party) resides in Europe. With PSD2, PISPs effectively take over the "front office" activities of all banks. End-users consolidate information about all bank-accounts with a PISP; authorized payments to a named beneficiary are then securely managed by the PISP. The PISP also maintains a consolidated list of all consumer transactions in a single location, organizing the hitherto haphazard front-office of a typical retail bank.

                   PSD2 also supports faster-payments. Businesses and consumers alike can by choice bypass credit-cards entirely and pay merchants securely and efficiently from their bank accounts, with the attendant benefits of zero commissions and greater efficiency.
