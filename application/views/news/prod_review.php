                        An early entrant in the hybrid cloud integration race, Fiorano appears to be on the right track as it continues with its distributed peer-to-peer integration architecture and a somewhat more recent API management chassis.

                    <p>
                        The Palo Alto-based company empowers real-time, digital enterprises with a bimodal integration and API management strategy
                        to deliver solutions across cloud, on-premise and hybrid environments. Fiorano's API management platform delivers security and monitoring capabilities to assess API performance,
                        along with metering and management capabilities.
                        <br><br>
                        The platform performs manifold functionalities such as building simplified APIs, providing proxies on top of existing APIs, client management, automated creation, and deployment of relevant artifacts. <em>&quot;Our platform is built in an extensible manner, so that any custom protocols and formats can be easily integrated with it and used like any other prebuilt feature,&quot;</em> elucidates Saini. Fiorano's platform also incorporates a management server that serves as the repository and controller for the platform while the runtime is handled by one or multiple gateway servers clustered as environments. The analytics information from gateway servers is collected by the integrated management server through a reliable Java Message Service (JMS) channel, even in times when the management server is down. Moreover, all the security-related lookups at runtime are formulated from a Big Data (Cassandra) server tuned for efficient read performance.

                        One of the hottest new terms in the world of enterprise computing is the microservice. Starting with the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">seminal 2014 article by James Lewis and Martin Fowler</a> of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>, microservices have taken on a life of their own - and as with any other overhyped term, they have generated their fair share of confusion as well.
                        <br><br>
                        The focus of this article, however, is on how microservices communicate with each other and with everything else. As Janakiram points out, such communication should be lightweight and platform-agnostic, what Lewis and Fowler refer to as dumb pipes.
                        <br><br>
                        Rethinking the smart endpoints/dumb pipes dichotomy as smart endpoints/web scale pipes sends a better message about the proper approach to integration in a microservices architecture. Furthermore, this way of thinking about microservice integration opens up an appropriate consideration of a broad class of web scale integration technologies, including products from companies like Fiorano Software

                        This scrappy Palo Alto and Bengaluru-based vendor competed successfully in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) market with the middleware behemoths of the time, including IBM, Oracle, Software AG WebMethods, and TIBCO, to name a few. While other smaller vendors were either acquired or dropped off the radar, the secret to Fiorano's survival was a critical architectural decision that differentiated their ESB in fundamental ways. <a href="http://www.fiorano.com/docs/Intellyx_BrainBlog_WhitePaper_for_Fiorano.pdf" class="bold" target="_blank">More &raquo;</a>

                        SOA Cost Comparison depends on looking at software systems in a stack in an IT data center. Managing
                        a stack takes a lot of expertise, some of the management is automated, some of it manual. The problem
                        with automated process is that it is difficult to change and can be inflexible. If you change one thing, it
                        may make things that were working stop working. The problems with manual process are all related to
                        the cost of developer and manager time. <br/>

                        approaches in the form of a hybrid integration infrastructure. The platform is a simple and efficient solution to the various complex integration issues that organizations are facing in the current business environment. While its prominent use case is on-premise to cloud integration, it is also capable of fulfilling the requirements of cloud to cloud, intra-cloud, and B2B integrations. One of the differentiating features of this platform is the underlying peer-to-peer architecture that ensures a more efficient and flexible realtime integration by providing centralized control and greater data access flexibility. <a href="http://www.fiorano.com/docs/On_the_Radar_Fiorano.pdf" target="_blank" class="bold">More &raquo;</a>

                                Why the middleware-in-the-Cloud approach to PaaS is doomed to fail</strong></a><br/>
                        &quot;ZapThink, of course, saw the world of SOA-enabled BPM quite differently. In our view, the Service-oriented way of looking at BPM was to free it from the engines, and focus on Services: composing them and consuming them. But there was a catch: Services are inherently stateless. The challenge with the Service-oriented approach to BPM was how to main state for each process instance in an inherently stateless environment.<br />
                        <br />
                        &quot; We tackled the problem of state head on <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/2006/10/31/should-services-be-stateful/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">back          in 2006, when we discussed how to maintain state in compositions          of stateless Services</a> that implement processes. Then <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/2008/11/17/why-today-is-a-perfect-time-for-no-platform-soa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in 2008, we discussed how you could free SOA-based BPM from middleware</a> by maintaining state in message interactions between Services and their consumers. If you got this right, you wouldn&rsquo;t need a heavyweight process engine to do it for you. <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/node/2190046" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">More &raquo;</a>

                        We want to favor responding to change over following a plan&ndash;even if that plan is how SOA or even REST is &ldquo;supposed to be done.&rdquo; The goal is stuff that actually addresses the business problem, not some adherence to official dogma. Therefore, it came as no surprise to us when an organization [the United States Coast Guard (USCG)] contacted us and let us know that they are taking the REST-based SOA approach. What the USCG has done is implement an architecture that actually works for them that is, it delivers loosely coupled, abstracted Business Services with the flexibility and performance they require. And remember, <em>actually working</em> trumps following a pre-determined set of best practices every time &ndash; especially when those best practices don&rsquo;t actually solve the problems at hand. <br />
                        <br />
                        USCG's <em>SPEAR </em>approach is taking a fully Service-oriented      approach to maintaining state. They are able to do so in spite of      leveraging an ESB because they selected the Fiorano ESB, which has long maintained state in a fully message-centric manner, instead of spawning threads to keep track of state as in other vendors&rsquo; ESBs. <br />
                        <br />
                        There are two important morals here. First, REST-based SOA is alive and well, and offers straightforward solutions to many of the knottier problems that Web Services-based SOA has suffered from. But even more importantly, the success the USCG has achieved shows that any architectural approach is nothing more than a loose collection of best practices. <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/2011/08/04/rest-based-soa-an-iconoclastic-approach/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">More &raquo;</a>
