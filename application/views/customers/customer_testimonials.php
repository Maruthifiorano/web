                                            Fiorano has streamlined the entire application architecture in the bank. It has simplified the time required for development of interfaces between the core banking application and satellite applications. Prior to Fiorano, a medium complexity interface (with 5 message types) would take about 3 weeks (15 man days) for development. Now with Fiorano, we complete the development activity in a week time (5 man days)." <br>
                                            <br>"During the initial phase, the plan was to integrate the complex interfaces through Fiorano. Since that has been completed successfully, we have planned to migrate all the current and future interfaces to Fiorano,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

                                                "We used a SAP system to record transactions on our purchases. We needed to share a lot of information with suppliers on purchase order quantities, delivery schedules; quantity of supply accepted and rejected reasons for rejections, accounts payable information and more. There were multiple levels of manual intervention for sharing of data with relevant vendors and entering vendor responses back into the system. This system resulted in prolonged lead times, inefficient working capital turnover and higher rates of error.

                                                The requirement was to automate the entire workflow and speedup the business process. The first challenge was determining the enterprise architecture and second choosing a vendor. We evaluated several technologies and vendors and after a due diligence process and proof of concept over a period of 6 months we decided on implementing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), choosing Fiorano to deliver that technology to UB."

With the Fiorano SOA Platform, development processes from configuration to deployment were very smooth and easy so that alternative business scenarios could be completed very quickly. In addition, Fiorano's REST adapter and event-port mechanism eliminated the effort of script coding (such as branching by IF or WHEN statements in XSLT syntax) which are required by other products. We saved significant time in creating and deploying REST APIs for business partners just by parameter settings in the Wizard."

                                                "We decided to adopt the Fiorano ESB, Enterprise Service Bus to address scalability challenges. The Fiorano SOA platform has a powerful Enterprise Service Bus (Fiorano ESB) that connects with multiple applications via a comprehensive set of bundled adaptors. By using peer-to-peer messaging rather than a central server approach, Fiorano ESB eliminates bottlenecks associated with a central server approach. Our plan is to run the Fiorano ESB on a private cloud to expand accessibility to a wider range of travel agencies throughout the world.

                                                The multiple autonomous software components that comprise the Fiorano SOA platform provide further performance improvements by avoiding the need for control or intervention by a process engine running on a central server."
