                <abbr title="Fiorano Architecture Assessment and Design">FAAD</abbr> will not only help you review your current architecture and existing IT Landscape, but also help design and build a robust architecture based on Fiorano's peer-to-peer SOA Platform. FAAD services can be utilized for building seamless hybrid cloud architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                For complex implementations, multiple peer servers are often required to exploit parallelism and increase deployment flexibility.  Before any solution is implemented on the Fiorano platform, the application processes (also called &quot;Event Processes&quot;) must be designed to map the business requirements properly.  There are several 'best practices' to increase productivity. These are best learned from Fiorano experts through our <abbr title="Fiorano Architecture Assessment and Design">FAAD</abbr> process.
