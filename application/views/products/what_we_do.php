                        <h4>We Understand the Integrators Dilemma</h4>
                        <p> The proliferation of cloud, mobile, social and big data projects have led enterprises to shift their integration competency from the back office to the omnichannel digital world. Fiorano provides a high-speed approach to integration that enterprises require for their high-velocity IT projects which typically rely on a cloud-friendly architecture with ultra-fast time to deployment, while also allowing business users to perform lightweight, self-service data and application integration - 'citizen integration'. Unlike the more traditional integration approaches, Fiorano provides interoperability using RESTful protocols, JSON formats, <a href="/products/api-management.php">API management</a> and cloud-streams for enabling near-real-time integration across ecosystems within digital business moments.</p>
