                        <p class="justify"> The proliferation of cloud, mobile, social and big data projects have led enterprises to shift their integration competency from the back office to the omnichannel digital world. Fiorano provides a high-speed approach to integration that enterprises require for their high-velocity IT projects which typically rely on a cloud-friendly architecture with ultra-fast time to deployment, while also allowing business users to perform lightweight, self-service data and application integration - 'citizen integration'. Unlike the more traditional integration approaches, Fiorano provides interoperability using RESTful protocols, JSON formats, <a href="<?php echo site_url('products/fiorano_api')?>">API management</a> and cloud-streams for enabling near-real-time integration across ecosystems within digital business moments.</p>
