                        June 20, 2017, London – Fiorano Software, a leader in enterprise integration, today announced that EBank, a major commercial bank operating in Namibia, has successfully implemented Fiorano ESB to fulfill integration requirements at the Bank. The EBank team was specifically looking for an easy to configure middleware solution to handle a host of different interfaces with the ability to be operated without onsite programmers. With its out-of-the-box integration with Temenos T24 core banking, the Fiorano ESB perfectly suited their requirements and allowed the EBank team to swiftly set up its interfaces for various channels.

                        EBank’s vision is to empower customers with branchless banking, radically increasing convenience for its customers. EBank has achieved digital banking transformation through user friendly electronic channels that enable clients to open accounts, link debit cards and transact from their mobile phone or personal computer without having to walk into a physical branch. In addition, EBank has associations with a network of retail outlets at which EBank clients can withdraw and deposit cash and pay for goods or services at the retailer using just their mobile phones.

                    </p><p>
                        The integrations with retail partners and other value-added services provider are complex in nature and require powerful applications to ensure that transactions flowing through these integrations are transmitted in real-time and secure. <a href="<?php echo site_url('products/fiorano_esb')?>" target="_blank"> Fiorano ESB </a>, underpinned with its unique peer-to-peer architecture and complimented with a pre-built library of  <a href="<?php echo site_url('products/fiorano_microservices')?>" target="_blank"> Microservices</a>, empowers the bank to rapidly onboard partners across multiple delivery channels. Gerald Riedel of EBank further commented,”….in addition, Fiorano’s clients, such as banks have the option to buy a multitude of different microservices/adapters that convert most known message standards or message types from one format into another. This includes various ISO, xml & text adaptors. As such, customization at core banking system level is minimal as all message format conversion is handled efficiently by ESB.”
